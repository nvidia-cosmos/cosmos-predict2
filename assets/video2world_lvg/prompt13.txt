A nighttime urban street scene viewed from inside a vehicle, likely captured by a dashboard camera, unfolds under a dark sky illuminated by streetlights casting a greenish hue. The road stretches ahead, marked by clear lane directions: a left-turn arrow, left-turn and straight arrows, and a right-turn arrow painted on the asphalt. On the left side, a beige building with multiple windows is partially obscured by a tree. A yellow and black traffic sign stands near the curb, indicating a curve ahead and traffic lights turning from green to yellow. The ego vehicle turns right with varying speed onto the road, where a traffic light is seen yellow with a white and black sign above it. As the vehicle moves forward, a vehicle is seen in the distance. The road markings are prominently visible, guiding traffic flow. To the right, a fire hydrant and a larger structure, possibly a commercial building with a "Walgreens" sign, are partially visible. The area appears quiet with minimal traffic, and the overall atmosphere is calm and subdued due to the late hour. The video progresses with the vehicle continuing its steady movement through this quiet, dimly lit environment, maintaining the same elements in view: the beige building, the yellow and black traffic sign, and the larger structure on the right. The streetlights continue to cast their greenish glow, and the road markings remain prominent. The scene remains largely unchanged throughout the video, with no significant actions or new objects appearing. The final frame shows the vehicle continuing its steady movement through this quiet, dimly lit environment.
