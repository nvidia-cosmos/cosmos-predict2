A humanoid robot stands in the center-right of the frame against a dark, gradient background transitioning from black at the bottom to a lighter gray at the top. The robot is positioned on a reflective surface, mirroring its image below. It has a sleek, white body with black accents on the joints and lower legs. The robot's head features two glowing blue eyes, adding a futuristic touch. Its arms are initially bent at the elbows, with the hands positioned near the waist. The robot then raises its right arm, extending it outward while keeping its left hand in place. The robot's gaze remains fixed forward throughout the sequence. By the final frame, the robot continues to stand with its right arm extended outward, while its left hand remains near its waist. The scene is captured in a medium shot with a slight upward angle, emphasizing the robot's movements and the reflective surface beneath it.
