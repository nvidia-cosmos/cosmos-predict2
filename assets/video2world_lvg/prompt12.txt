A video shot from inside a vehicle, looking out through the windshield onto a quiet suburban street on a sunny day. The road is a two-lane asphalt road marked with yellow center lines and white edge lines. On the left side, there's a row of houses with brick exteriors and green lawns, bordered by trees providing shade. On the right side, two trash cans sit on the curb near the sidewalk, and another house with a light-colored exterior and a wooden fence is visible. The sky above is clear and blue, indicating a bright day. The hood of the car is partially visible at the bottom of the frame, reflecting the sunlight. As the car moves forward, it approaches an intersection where two speed-limit signs indicating 25 mph become visibleâ€”one near the center of the road and the other on the right side. The camera angle remains fixed, capturing the steady advance of the vehicle. The houses, trees, and trash cans on the sidewalk remain stationary, maintaining their initial positions. The road markings, including the yellow center lines and white edge lines, remain consistent throughout the frames. The sky stays clear and blue, and the sunlight continues to reflect off the car's dashboard. The scene is static except for the movement of the car itself.
